UBIQUE 0.0.2
============

Ubique is a powerful and extended math library for Javascript and Node.js. It supports arrays, vectors and matrices, providing functionalities in a MATLAB速-like style.

Easy to use, no dependencies.


Project Summary
===============

The project aims to create an environment for mathematical and statistical analysis in Javascript and Node.js, featuring typical MATLAB速 matrix and array manipulation. A very large collection of functions in underdevelopment for:

- array creation and concatenation, indexing, sorting and reshaping
- elementary operations
- elementary math
- linear algebra
- statistics

The library is a good starting point to convert MATLAB速 users to Javascript and Node.js, building new scalable client-server scientific applications.
